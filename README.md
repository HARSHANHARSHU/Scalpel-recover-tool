# Scalpel-recover-tool
scalpel is a fast file carver that reads a database of header and footer definitions and extracts matching files from a set of image files or raw device files.

scalpel is filesystem-independent and will carve files from FAT16, FAT32, exFAT, NTFS, Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, JFS, XFS, ReiserFS, raw partitions, etc.

scalpel is a complete rewrite of the Foremost 0.69 file carver and is useful for both digital forensics investigations and file recovery.
